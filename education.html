              &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm beyond blessed to have the opportunity to study here in Canada as an International Student. January of 2021 when I decided to try my luck and began researching about the application process, I collected my documents, paid my tuition deposit to receive my Letter of Scceptance and on March I lodged my online application at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada.html" 
            style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline; font-size:.9em " target="_blank" >Canada's official website</a>
            , the waiting game was stressfull because there was no assurance that it will be approved but on the last week on June 2021 I received what I've been waiting for- my visa approval. <br/> <br/>
             &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They accepted me at Douglas college and currently I'am taking up an IT-post degree course, which is related to my
            bachelor's dgree in college and with my work experience. I arrived here in August and began my studies in September.  The adjustment was really hard, including surges of homesickness and the cold weather but with determination and support from my family I am now almost on my third term. <br/> <br/>
             &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I choose the Emerging Technology Stream because of the subjects which are included in the course, specifically Mobile Application and Development, AJAX and Javascript Libraries and UI/UX Design. I believe that these subjects and the new technologies that we will be using in the course work will enable me to develop my programming skills to leverage my carreer. <br/> <br/>
            Studying in Douglas College, in a foreign and English-speaking country is both fun and challenging because I have classmates from around the world and competitive professors who teaches us not just lessons from the subject but also
          prepares us to be globally competitive. <br/> <br/>
            Below is a video of what is it like to be an International Student at Douglas College.
